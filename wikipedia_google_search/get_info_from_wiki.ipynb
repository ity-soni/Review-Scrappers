    "### Information Retriever from Wikipedia ###\n",
    "This code is used to retrieve information from Wikipedia for any search query entered by the user. The code first uses the Google Search API to find relevant Wikipedia pages for the user's query, and then uses the Wikipedia API to retrieve additional information from those pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including the requests library for making HTTP requests and the Google Search API client library for querying Google. Next, the user can enter a search query in the function as shown below:<br><br>\n",
    "    `get_wiki_info('guns and roses')`\n",
    "\n",
    "The entered query is then used as the basis for a Google search. The code uses the Google Search API to retrieve the top results for the query and filters them to only include Wikipedia pages. Once the relevant Wikipedia pages have been identified, the code uses the Wikipedia API to retrieve information from those pages, such as the title, summary, and full URL. The code then passes this information to the Wikipedia API and extracts the information needed, which is then displayed to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the accuracy of the information returned by the code is dependent on both the information available on Wikipedia and the relevance of the Google search results for the user's query. Additionally, the information returned by the code may not always be up-to-date or completely accurate, and it is only a small portion of the information available on Wikipedia."
